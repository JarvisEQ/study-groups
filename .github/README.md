# study-groups
When we cover MOOCs as a group, like fast.ai, here's a depository for everyone 
to use and use to collaborate on.

## Motivation
While we strive to provide as much as we can through our lectures and workshops; 
nothing compares to having a group of people who you go through a MOOC with. And
ultimately, this is what it takes to be a part of the DST (Data Science Team) â€“ 
everyone who spends time outside of class and the club are the highest 
performers of the club's members. :smiley: :thumbsup:

## What is this?
Like the first sentence of this doc says, every semester we host a study group 
to go through online courses, or similar things, outside of regular club meeting 
times. You'll learn more through these than what most classes have to over, so 
it's highly encouraged to make it to these and participate.
